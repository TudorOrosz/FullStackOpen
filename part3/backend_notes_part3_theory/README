# How to create a project like this one:
1. Create a folder and an index.js file, and run 'npm init'.
2. Fill the details for npm init
3. Run 'npm install express' to install express
4. In package.json add the following to the scripts object:
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "node --watch index.js",
    The first will help in starting the server with 'npm start'
    Teh second will help in starting the dev server and keep restarting it when changes are made to index.js (like with nodemon) with 'npm run dev'


NB: If unsure, look at the package.json file and see what details, dependencies etc. you hvae there
